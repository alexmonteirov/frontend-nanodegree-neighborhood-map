# Neighborhood Map - Duque de Caxias

This is my project created for the Nanodegree Front End course of Udacity. I've made a neighborhood map with some third-party APIs and displayed points of interest located in the city of Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro.

### Project elements:
- Google Maps JavaScript API
- Foursquare API
- JQuery
- KnockoutJS
- Bootstrap

### Introduction
Because we use the Foursquare API, you can get useful information like phones and website and show this by clicking on place marker, when we don't have any information the display message will be 'undefined'.

You can filter the locations both by category and by typing in the search bar.

### How to use
1. You can acess the online map [here.](http://alexmonteirov.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map)
2. Click on the markers to informations about our locals.
3. Click on the 'Display' button to open a side-bar and search for one specific place or filter by categories.
4. When unchecking one category, the filtered displayed places will be modified.

### How to contribute?
1. [Download](https://github.com/alexmonteirov/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map/archive/master.zip) or clone this repository
2. Navigate to the local directory
3. Open the index.html file in a web browser (I used Google Chrome)
4. Send your change suggestion to me, and I'll evaluate the implementation.
